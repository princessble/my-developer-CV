    <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>
      I am writing to express my interest in an entry-level Junior Software
      Developer / RPA Developer position within your organization. I am
      currently transitioning into software development after building a strong
      professional foundation in regulated medical device manufacturing, and I
      am excited to apply my technical training, structured thinking, and
      problem-solving skills in a software-focused role.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently completed formal training in Backend Software Engineering with
      African Leadership University (ALX), alongside certifications in Robotic
      Process Automation (School of Automation, Dublin), AI for Developers, and
      AI Career Essentials. Through these programs, I gained hands-on experience
      working with Python, JavaScript, SQL, REST APIs, automation workflows, and
      full-stack web development concepts. I have also built academic and
      practical projects involving backend logic, database-driven applications,
      and automated workflows designed to eliminate repetitive manual tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background as a Builder II at Boston Scientific has strongly shaped how
      I approach technology. Working in a highly regulated environment required
      strict adherence to procedures, precise documentation, quality assurance,
      and the ability to work with complex systems under minimal supervision.
      These experiences translate directly to software development, where
      accuracy, traceability, structured thinking, and clean execution are
      critical. I am particularly drawn to roles involving automation and
      backend systems, as they align naturally with my process-oriented mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a highly motivated learner, comfortable adapting to new tools and
      technologies, and I enjoy working both independently and within
      collaborative teams. I am now seeking an opportunity where I can continue
      to grow as a junior developer, contribute meaningfully to real-world
      projects, and add value through automation, efficiency, and thoughtful
      software design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity
      to discuss how my technical training, automation focus, and professional
      discipline can contribute to your development team.
    </p>
    <p>Kind regards,</p>
    <p>Blessing Fortune Kwomo</p>
